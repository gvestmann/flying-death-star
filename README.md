# flying-death-star

This is a little module I worked on for a school assignment about modules, package managers, bundlers, etc.

It's a simple thing that put's a Death Star floating over your website. The JS script will inject all the necessary HTML automatically. It includes some CSS code that needs to be used for the thing to work. 

Idea for setup: use Parcel to import fly.js to your main JS-file or simply reference it straight from your HTML. Add fly.css to your CSS-folder or merge it with style.css.

The only dependency is jQuery.
